summary: Games involving other people change us, the way we think and perceive the world. This comes true especially for titles requiring cooperation versus another group, where blame — a very toxic thing — becomes a standard.

I have extensive experience with both single and multiplayer games. Recently I was thinking about writing a post about how different from each other they have become and why. Moreover, I'm going to look at why are we so willing to compete with each other. I'm going to try and explain my reasoning in every example, but surely someone might disagree with my opinions (like I care).

### Single Player

Solo gaming was the first and main type of gaming out there. Titles that are exclusively single player often focus on an engrossing story, character development, immersion or — on the other hand — mechanics that are simply unavailable to achieve in a multiplayer environment (see roguelikes like Cataclysm: DDA or Dwarf Fortress and millions of options they provide). They are very stress-free, you can play however you want, whenever you want, as well as quit at any time. No one will judge you by your performance, it's like reading a book or watching a film, just you and your entertainment.

### Multiplayer

Nowadays multiplayer games are much more prevalent than, say, ten years ago. We have dozens of MMOs, but recently MOBAs of all kinds have taken the leader position in terms of "group fun". While yes, they are extremely enjoyable, they are also very, very toxic if you don't control yourself. As with any internet community, games are filled with trolls, hate-speech, racism and so on. 

I play Dota 2, hence I know all of this first hand — you must be prepared that every single mistake you make in a public game will be pointed out. Believe me, this kills **all the fun**. I admit, sometimes I get angry at people who are, purposefully or not, terrible at the game, yet I never openly attack them for being like that. A lot of people do. This is especially common in MOBAs like Dota, since a single player can ruin the experience of the remaining four. There is nothing to be done about that, as this is inherent to the mechanics of the game, so the only *cure*, so to speak, is to play only with trusted people you know (a so called "stack").

Friends are much more forgiving of your mistakes, even if they are not, they will make sure they won't be harsh while pointing something out. The toxic environment of multiplayer games is the main reason a lot of people prefer to simply watch them on streams instead of actually playing. I believe the main reason why people believe that score is much more important than fun is the western culture we've been brought up in, encouraging competitive sports and skills every step of the way.

### Tommy Is The Best In Class

I cannot stress this enough — all my life since I first stepped into the school we've been taught to be the best at, well, everything. You simply cannot be "average", "mediocre", because you're not *trying hard enough*. Someone tell me, why the fuck do we create school lists of the best students? Why do we always strive to be the best at everything, even though, honestly, it doesn't bring a lot of joy to one's life?

Sure, you can be ambitious, but don't lose yourself in the never-ending rat race to the top. School, everyday jobs and multiplayer games encourage us to constantly challenge not only ourselves, but also others, to always beat them, or else we suck. While challenging yourself is healthy and educating experience, you should do that at your own pace, instead of comparing yourself to others — they are **not you**, they have their own skills, their own priorities, why the hell would you care how they perform?

The point I'm trying to make is very simple and it's going to sound very preachy.

How about, for once, we focus on how to help another person instead of judging their performance? How about, instead of critizing their in-game, in-work, in-whatever skills, we tell them what's wrong and how to fix it?

Whenever we feel that we're better than others, more skilled, more experienced, we should not boast and act like proud douchebags. Instead, reach out to others and teach those who are worse off. If you're surrounded with happy people who are satisfied by their own life and work, you're going to be even happier.

> Whatever you do to others, bounces back at you. Be a prick, and someone you care about will act a prick towards you. Same goes the other way around. Life's that simple.
