title: Death of Music Piracy?
date: 2014-11-16 12:04
excerpt: Remember the times when there was no Spotify, no Rdio, no Deezer? Most of you probably do, as most - if not all of you - used to download mp3 files on a regular basis, not only filling the hard drive up, but also robbing the artists (who do not earn a lot from sold records in the first place, live concerts are the primary way to do that - so technically robbing record companies, which is not half bad actually) and breaking the law in the process. Now, I don't want to go all sanctimonious on you, I'm guilty of all that as well.

Remember the times when there was no Spotify, no Rdio, no Deezer? Most of you probably do, as most - if not all of you - used to download mp3 files on a regular basis, not only filling the hard drive up, but also robbing the artists (who do not earn a lot from sold records in the first place, live concerts are the primary way to do that - so technically robbing record companies, which is not half bad actually) and breaking the law in the process. Now, I don't want to go all sanctimonious on you, I'm guilty of all that as well.

Still, as the internet is growing and more people have access to the higher capacity connections (especially on mobile), we resorted to newer, more satisfying and comfortable solutions. Spotify and the like presented us with the possibility of **free music** wherever we are (as long as we're online, and even that changed when you have a subscription - cheap, by the way). You can listen to a huge catalogue, discover new artists, new songs, all for free, all within an easy-to-use application available on both PCs and smartphones.

I remember when those services first started â€“ a lot of people weren't so sure about them being the ultimate piracy killers. However, time has proved them wrong. Today, many of my friends use streaming applications pretty much exclusively (I do, too!), even if only for simplicity and the fact they're easy to use. Piracy, as was stated many times already, is a service problem.

In the past, when you wanted a song or an album, you had to buy it, straight up. Not everyone (and certainly not me) is willing to grab a whole album just for one or two good songs. Later on one could buy and download single tracks using, for example, iTunes - which is extremely clumsy, slow and you don't really own your music (as is the case with Steam and its' games). Hence, searching a particular site with a ship for its' logo and clicking twice to get whatever album you want was a breeze. How to combat that?

Certainly not with DRM, which brings more pain upon legitimate buyers than it does on pirates. Answer then, is simple and comes down to the easier, faster and all in all cooler service that people would really feel like using long-term. Ordinary users, John Does of the internet, who really don't care much whether the song is pirated or not, but care a lot if something's easy to do and works out of the box. If not, they won't use it and roll back to the torrent. Simple. Same principle applies to films (Netflix) and game distribution (GOG.com).

So really, to sum it up - if you have never used Spotify, Deezer, Rdio or something similar, you owe it to yourself to try at least one out. So much music in such approachable format, no moral guilt, just great pleasure of listening - and no, this isn't a marketing campaign. I sincerely enjoy using Spotify (my choice, as it has the best support in Poland), as it offers fantastic service, which literally stopped me from hoarding mp3s.
