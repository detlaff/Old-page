title: Importance of Speaking Up
date: 2014-12-07 15:02
excerpt: Sometimes the only way to gain your superior's respect is to defy him. Often it is beneficial to you to ask for directions (no, not only on the road), instead of wandering around like a headless chicken. Talking to literally everyone while partying, instead of only the people you know well, will land you dozens of new friends, contacts and guys you can rely on. I can't stress that enough - being proactive instead of shy or even reactive will, first of all, make you much more happy, and to add to that - people will find you engaging and interesting. Different.

Obligatory Christmas song. I am sincerely sorry.

Today I am going to talk to you about something I recently wrote about, but in a different context. In this post, the aim is to focus solely on one thing that makes life so much easier - the courage of speaking up. Now, at this point in my life, I sincerely think that shyness is a serious issue hampering one's development as a human being. As a teenager I used to be very shy, even took pride in being anti-social to some extent, but this was simply bullshit. Again, humans are social animals and only by interacting with others, one is able to discover him/herself truly.

It's not that being alone is wrong, it isn't. I still need my time alone, every single day. Thinking about recent events and trying to figure it all out is a process best done solo - in the end you are the one living your life. You are able to discover some things about yourself (ie. what you like, what would you like, or how to decide on something) very quickly if you start, literally, talking to yourself. It can be out loud, it can be in your head, but don't be afraid to **ask yourself** some questions, important ones. Nothing wrong with that, you ain't going mad, and it might just help you out on the road ahead.

However, back to the point. Shyness can be *cured*, so to speak. Shy people sometime take this trait as a virtue, sometimes they try to fight it - in my opinion, you should always try to get rid of it. For more than 2-3 years, whenever I was faced with a dilemma - to act or not to act, to ask or not to ask, I have always chosen the first option. With fantastic results.

Sometimes the only way to gain your superior's respect is to defy him. Often it is beneficial to you to ask for directions (no, not only on the road), instead of wandering around like a headless chicken. Talking to literally **everyone** while partying, instead of only the people you know well, will land you dozens of new friends, contacts and guys you can rely on. I can't stress that enough - being proactive instead of shy or even reactive will, first of all, make you much more happy, and to add to that - people will find you engaging and interesting. Different.

Surely there's a lot of stuff you'd like changed in your life. Family affairs, love life, working conditions or salary, any other thing that might leave you feeling stressed and insecure. Instead of complaining and whining, which we have a habit of doing, start working at it. What I'm about to say will seem a little like a nice paradox, but you can only fix this stuff **yourself** while working with **others**. You must initiate the changes in your life, gather up the courage to speak up, to fight for your own, but you must do that **with** others - your friends, colleagues, partners, even your boss. You'd be suprised how responsive and friendly can they all be, as long as you believe in yourself too. As long as you accept yourself and are willing to change things that stress you out, despite the inherent risk associated with it.

Nice touch at the end - I would not be myself if I wasn't plainspoken. As my gaming friends often say - **grow some balls**.
